- **Advanced Data Querying**: Utilizes LlamaIndex for sophisticated data retrieval, Document querying and processing, ensuring quick and accurate access to the necessary information.
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: Incorporates multiple language models that work together to analyze and process data, providing a comprehensive understanding of text-based information.
- **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Equipped with various tools, the system intelligently selects the most appropriate tool based on the specific use case scenario, optimizing performance and results.
- **Automated Code Generation**: Feeds data, including code files, to the agent, which then generates relevant code snippets or entire programs based on the input provided.
- **Result Persistence**: Outputs are systematically parsed and saved to a designated output folder, making it easy to access and utilize generated data.
- **Scalable architecture**: suitable for expanding with more features or models.
