## Project Overview
<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>
This project uses advanced AI components to efficiently handle complex data querying and manipulation tasks. It is designed to leverage multiple language models (LLMs), integrated using the Retriever-Answer Generator (RAG) framework, to enhance the processing and understanding of large datasets.

### Key Features
- **Advanced Data Querying**: Utilizes LlamaIndex for sophisticated data retrieval, ensuring quick and accurate access to the necessary information.
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: Incorporates multiple language models that work together to analyze and process data, providing a comprehensive understanding of text-based information.
- **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Equipped with various tools, the system intelligently selects the most appropriate tool based on the specific use case scenario, optimizing performance and results.
- **Automated Code Generation**: Feeds data, including code files, to the agent, which then generates relevant code snippets or entire programs based on the input provided.
- **Result Persistence**: Outputs are systematically parsed and saved to a designated output folder, making it easy to access and utilize generated data.


Models used:
- **LlamaIndex**:  indexing and retrieval capabilities for llm applications.
- **Ollama**: A powerful language model for understanding and generating human-like 
text.
- **RAG**: Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- **Multi-LLM**: Utilizes multiple language models to enhance processing power and accuracy.
