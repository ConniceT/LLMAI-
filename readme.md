<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>
This project builds on several advanced AI components to handle complex data querying, manipulation. Leverage multiple llms that are connected and parse results to an output.Provide data to model which contains code files can run the model to generate code based on the code that is provided. the agent is provide with different tools and will decide the best tool to use base on the use case senario. the result is the saved to output folder.


- **LlamaIndex**:  indexing and retrieval capabilities for llm applications.
- **Ollama**: A powerful language model for understanding and generating human-like 
text.
- **RAG** : Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- **Multi-LLM**: Utilizes multiple language models to enhance processing power and accuracy.
